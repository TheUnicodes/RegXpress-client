Our project, 'regXpress', is a real time contest application where one or more players solve complex, scenario based questions using regular expressions. Socket.IO was a new technology we learned in order to enable the realtime communication between multiple users.  For our front-end framework, we used AngularJS to bring our app to fruition. Throughout the week, we effectively communicated about what needed to be done, and who would work on which component.  Feature branching on Github was used to keep merge conflicts to a minimum.
